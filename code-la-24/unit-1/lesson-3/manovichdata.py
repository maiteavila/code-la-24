variability = ["Varibility builds on modularity", "New media objects can exist in different, potentionally infinite versions"]

automation = ["The numerical coding of media and the modular structure of a media object allow for the automation of many operations involved in media creation, manipulation, and access." "Example: Word processing, page layout, presentation, and Web creation programs come with 'agents' that can automatically create the layout of a document."]

numericalrepresentation = ["New media objects, whether created from scratch on computers or converted from analog media sources, are composed of digital code; they are numerical representations." "New media objects can be defined with a mathematical function" "A new media object is subject to algorithmic manipulation"]

modularity = ["These elements are assembled into larger-scale objects but continue ot maintain their separate identities.", "A new media object contains independent parts made up of smaller independent parts, down to the smallest layer", "Deleting, substitutin, adding parts does not render the object meaningless"]

transcoding = ["New media in general can be thought of as consisting of two distinct layers-the 'cultural layer' and the 'computer layer.'" "New media acts as a forerunner in the more general proces of cultural reconceprualization."]
