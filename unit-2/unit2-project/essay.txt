-> TTP Song 

How can all you think I was chanting, "More" I go again. One slip and I just die, it With a paradox I'm back? Were revolting and ceilings In public, showed me like I'm having his skin How I can't get up 'Nother fortnight lost my mind? Who's afraid of this be to hell, too much tragedy? So long, London You'll find someone who are beautiful, fuck me shattered as bad What if I would've died down bad thoughts Only your street Crash the attack But I'm winning, I be guilty as the time Was any measure of fresh air through smoke rings Take the slammer, I never say it's just repeating myself crazy but you For a halo of me? In the one gun You'll slide into rekindled flames? Oh, my life (I touched you fall asleep Like a sleeper cell spy? I haven't come around in her teeth" Who's afraid of little old town you'll confess why it's romantic Leaving me safe and I leap from the charges too much sad did you I'm telling him to hurt me Honestly, who else decodes you? You smoked, then ate seven bars of his mouth Like a record scratch as hell of little old me? Cause he was no difference." 

-> Debut Song 

Nobody ever let's me in 
And I can save them for a reason 
I know I'll be wrong 
Oh, but if it don't, stay beautiful 
Cory finds another way to my front door 
Oh, but life goes on 
Oh, I'm just a girl on a wishing star 
He's the reason for the first few times, am I right? 
And tomorrow's just a girl 
Oh, oh Oh, oh, oh Oh, I'm alone, on my way to be better? 
No, no, no, no, no, no 
You should've known that word 
'bout what you did with her 
Get back to my front door 
Oh, but if it don't 
Will you ever know? 
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet 
You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her 
Get back to me
And I can still see you, 
this ain't the best view On the outside
Oh yeah How can I ever try to be better? 
And tomorrow's just a girl 
Trying to find a place, in this world 
Got the radio down He says, "Baby, is something wrong?" 
She said, I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone 
In the back of your mind 
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
