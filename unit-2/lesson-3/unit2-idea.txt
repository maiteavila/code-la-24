For my Unit 2 project, I will:

1.  Scrape Taylor Swift lyrics from her debut album Taylor Swift (2006) and her most recent album The Tortured Poets Department (2024) 

2. Manually clean up the text files. 

3. Use markovify to generate a new song for each album, to compare. 

4. Use additional code to compare the words, themes, etc. from each album to compare Swift's lyrical evolution.
